# Architecture Diagram

This folder contains the architecture diagram for the simulated AWS environment used in the security assessment.

## `environment-architecture (diagrams/environment-architecture.svg)`

The diagram illustrates the intentionally misconfigured AWS environment, including:

- **IAM layer** — Three users (`admin-user`, `dev-user`, `analyst-user`), the `LimitedAccess` group, and the `FullAccessCustomPolicy` attached directly to `dev-user`
- **Logging layer** — CloudTrail with disabled log validation, CloudWatch, and Insights
- **Storage layer** — S3 bucket (`tushar-risk-bucket`) with public access enabled and `customer_data.txt` exposed
- **Compute layer** — EC2 instance (`Risk-Instance`) in a default VPC with security group open to `0.0.0.0/0` on ports 22 and 80
- **Monitoring layer** — AWS Security Hub aggregating findings

Risk indicators are overlaid on misconfigured components to visually communicate the assessment findings.
